Hi! I am Zhijing Wang. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), advised by Prof. [Tao Wang](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/teachershow/tags/MDAwMDAwMDAwMLKeit0) and Prof. [Peirong Xu](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/teachershow/tags/MDAwMDAwMDAwMLKemJc).

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from the School of Statistics at Beijing Normal University (BNU) in 2022. During my statistical studies, I was fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. [Gaorong Li](https://stat.bnu.edu.cn/zwjl/247617.htm) and Prof. [Xun Zhang](https://stat.bnu.edu.cn/zwjl/249964.htm). In the same year, I also obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from the Business School at BNU in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Mi Dai](https://bshr.bnu.edu.cn/Public/htm/news/5/20.html).

My research interests mainly focus on **high-dimensional statistical models**, **factor analysis**, **model selection**, **sufficient dimension reduction**, **transfer learning**, and **text analysis**. I am also broadly interested in the applications of statistics and machine learning to solve significant problems in social and scientific fields, particularly in **economics**, **finance**, and **environmental science**.
