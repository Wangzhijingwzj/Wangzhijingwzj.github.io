My name is Zhijing Wang, and I am currently a Ph.D candidate in the  [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/index/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I received my Bachelor degree in Statistics in [School of Statistic](https://stat.bnu.edu.cn/) and Economy in [Business School](https://bs.bnu.edu.cn/) from Beijing Normal University in 2022. 


My research mainly focuses on high-dimensional statistical models, factor analysis, and demension reduction. I am also interested in the applications of statistics and machine learning in solving significant scientific/social problems (including economy, finance, environment).
